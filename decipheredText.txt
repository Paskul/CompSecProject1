After running steps 1 and 2 of the alphabetical frequency check with brute force, we are left with the key:
C -> I
K -> A
S -> E
G -> T
E -> O
U -> N
Q -> S
H -> R
B -> H
Z -> D
A -> C
I -> Y
N -> M
L -> L
X -> U
P -> P
R -> W
O -> K
W -> G
V -> F
F -> B
M -> V
D -> J
T -> Q
J -> X

2: L and R
3: I and R
4: V and R
5: D and W

* Note, hopper might have provided a slightly different key with similar steps, the deciphering -DOES!!- work on hopper, with a slightly different key structure after automation. This result is copy pasted from a local machine (for easy copy/paste without mistakes that I could have made from hopper). Hopper is still correct.
