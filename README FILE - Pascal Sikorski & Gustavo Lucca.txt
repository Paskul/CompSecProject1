FREQUENCY ANALYSIS - The frequency analysis is based on how many words appear on each iteration of the decryption. It will appear after the alphabetically sorted text, the computer-decrypted text, and after every manual substitution.

HOW TO USE PROGRAM - For the program to attempt to guess the cipher key and decrypt the text, all you need to do is run the code. The program will swap pairs of keys and keep a tally of how many words are in the dictionary in each iteration, and choose the key which produces the text with the most words.

HOW TO MANUALLY DECRYPT - After that, the user will manually swap the characters and alter the string until they are satisfied with the result. The program will get you about halfway there, and will prompt you to choose if you will manually alter the key in the terminal. If you decide to do so, you can swap the position of two characters in the text, and it will loop through this decision and alteration until you are satisfied with the result. Once they are done manually altering the string, they will terminate the program and the terminal will print the text one last time.
